## What are the Minimum System Requirements?

Projects that are applying for _**BERDE**_ Certification must comply with the following minimum system requirements:

* Compliance with building and environmental laws, regulations, and mandatory standards;
* Distinct and clear boundaries;
* Commitment to sharing resource data; and
* Initial site assessment.

<aside class="danger">Projects that do not comply with the minimum system requirements will be disqualified for <i><b>BERDE</b></i> Certification.</aside>

###  Compliance with building and environmental laws, regulations, and mandatory standards
The project team must ensure that the project is complying with all applicable building and environmental laws, regulations, and mandatory standards.  You must conduct a regulatory compliance review for the project to identify and assess compliance with the following:

* Relevant laws, regulations, and mandatory standards governing the practice of building design, construction, and operations;
* Relevant laws, regulations, and mandatory standards environmental requirements affecting the building performance; and
* Local ordinances applicable to the project.

During Stage 1, the project team must submit:

* Report on the regulatory compliance review for the project, which should include information on:
    * All applicable building and environmental laws, regulations for the project, and
    * Status of compliance of the project with the applicable regulations;
* Copy of the approved _Building Permit_ issued by the local government where the project is located; and
* Permits and issuances by the national and local government to show compliance with all relevant building and environmental laws, regulations, and mandatory standards with regards to the design and planning of the project.

During Stage 2, the project team must submit:

* Copy of the approved _Occupancy Permit_ issued by the local government where the project is located; and
* Permits and issuances by the national and local government to show compliance with all relevant building and environmental laws, regulations, and mandatory standards with regards to the construction of the project.

###  Distinct and clear boundaries

The project must be distinct and have clear boundaries.  You must identify the scope of the project, including all areas where utilities and shared building systems are located.

During Registration, the project team submit plans showing clearly the boundaries of the project for certification, which should include:

* Site plan prepared by the project designers, and
* Lot plan issued by the local government.

The project team must also illustrate how shared building systems and utilities with other projects are dedicated for the use of the project.

<aside class="success"><p>For example, the administration building of a school will undergo <b><i>BERDE</i></b> Certification.  The project is located in a campus with a shared parking space for bicycles.  The project team will be claiming the bicycle parking as a feature of the building for certification.</p>

The project team must:
<ul>
  <li>Include the area of the bicycle parking in the scope of the certification during Registration;</li>
  <li>Provide design documentation on the required total parking for the administration building's users during Stage 1;</li>
  <li>Provide documents showing the access of users from the administration building to the bicycle parking during Stage 1 and Stage 2; and</li>
  <li>Provide the total number of bicycle parking dedicated for the users of the administration building reflecting the same number or more required for the project.</li>
</aside>

###  Commitment to sharing resource data

The project owner must commit to sharing data on the use of energy, water, materials, and generated waste of the project.  To ensure consistency in data, we recommend that project teams prepare data using the metric system.

During Stage 1, the project team must submit information on:

* Projected occupancy rates,
* Energy consumption rates in kilo-watt (kW) based on the design,
* Water consumption rates in liters (L) based on the design,
* Projected waste generation in kilograms (kg), and
* Materials specified form the project.

During Stage 2, the project team must submit information on:

* Projected occupancy rates,
* Energy consumption rates in kW based on the implemented energy systems,
* Water consumption rates in L based on the implemented water-related strategies,
* Actual waste generated during construction in kg,
* Projected waste generation in kg for the operations of the project,
* Materials used in the project.

<aside class="success">
<p>The <b>projected occupancy rate</b> must be the <b>peak number of users for each 8-hour shift</b> of the project.</p>
<p>For example, an educational building with classes from 8:00AM to 9:00PM, and office hours of 8:00AM to 5:00PM.  The projected peak number of employees and visitors of the office is 1000 occupants.</p>

###  Initial site assessment
Prior to application for _**BERDE**_ Certification, the project team must conduct a site assessment prior to any construction activities to identify the following:

* Existing ecological features within and around the site, which should include information on:
    * Flora and fauna in the site, which may include:
        * Trees of significant ecological value,
        * Plants native to the site,
        * Existing adapted plants in the site, and
        * Existing animal species;
    * Natural watercourses,
    * Wetland areas,
    * Nearby bodies of water, and
    * Nearby protected areas;
* Previous developments in the site, which should include information on:
    * Footprint of the previous development in the site,
    * Previous use or type of building in the site,
    * Period the land was previously used, and
    * Existing site contamination;
* Rainfall and flood potential within and around the site;
* Potential hazard and risks related to construction activities of the project, which should include information on:
    * Stormwater flow,
    * Wind directions,
    * Dust generation,
    * Noise pollution, and
    * Traffic;
* Social and cultural value, which should include information on:
    * Heritage, historic, or cultural sites, structures, or properties within or around the site,
    * Heritage or cultural features of the community or town, and
    * Community programs on sustainability.

During Stage 1, the project team must submit a site assessment report.
