# About _**BERDE**_

The Philippine Green Building Council (PHILGBC) is a non-stock, non-profit organization that promotes the sharing of knowledge on green building practices to the industry to ensure a sustainable environment.  In 2009, the PHILGBC established the _**BERDE**_ (Building for Ecologically Responsive Design Excellence) Program to develop the Philippines' own national voluntary green building rating system to facilitate greener building projects in the country.

## What is _**BERDE**_?
The _**BERDE**_ Green Building Rating System is a tool to assess, measure, monitor, and certify the performance of green building projects above and beyond existing national and local building and environmental laws, regulations, and mandatory standards.

_**BERDE**_ is recognized by the Philippine government, through the Department of Energy (DOE), as the National Voluntary Green Building Rating System.

## Who developed _**BERDE**_?
_**BERDE**_ was developed by the Philippine Green Building Council (PHILGBC).  The DOE provided development and promotional support for the development of _**BERDE**_.

_**BERDE**_ was developed in line with the _Quality Assurance for Green Building Rating Tools_ (WorldGBC, 2013), the _International Framework for Socio-Economic Factors for Green Building Rating Tools in Developing Countries_ (WorldGBC & GBCSA, 2013), and other best practices from international standards for standards development.

Tools and documents under the _**BERDE**_ are drafted by the _**BERDE**_ Committee, with support from the _**BERDE**_ Program Secretariat, input from the PHILGBC General Membership, and final approval by the PHILGBC Board of Trustees.  Interested external parties were provided opportunities to comment and provide their insight on the drafting of the _**BERDE** GBRS_ as part of the development process.

The _**BERDE** GBRS_ is administered by the PHILGBC under the _**BERDE**_ Program.
