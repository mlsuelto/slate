## LE-03  Improvement of Ecological Features
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Improve or restore ecological features in the site and its immediate surroundings; and
* Contribute to the improvement of local biodiversity.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Implement strategies to prevent and control construction activity pollution, including:
    * Erosion brought about by stormwater,
    * Construction wastewater runoff,
    * Construction related sediments reaching receiving watercourses, and
    * Air pollution brought about by dust and particulate matters;
2. Identify strategies to improve the ecological features within the site, which should include:
    * Using native plant species,
    * Rehabilitating natural watercourses and wetland areas, or
    * Integrating green roofs and green walls;
2. Implement the identified strategies.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Records on the strategies to prevent and control construction activity pollution, which should include:
    * If the project targeted _LE-02 Protection of Ecological Features_, refer to documentation for the strategies for prevention and control of construction pollution activity;
    * If the project did not target _LE-02_, submit records on the strategies to prevent and control construction activity pollution, which should include:
        * Relevant sections of plans and specifications of the strategies,
        * Policies and procedures on preventing erosion and air pollution,
        * Purchase orders and official receipts,
        * Service contracts, and
        * Communication with project team on the strategies for construction activity pollution control;
* Design documentation on the identified strategies to improve the ecological features within the site, which should include:
    * Target improvement,
    * Plans and specifications on the identified strategies,
    * Purchase orders, and
    * Service contracts.
