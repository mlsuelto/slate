## LE-02  Protection of Ecological Features
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to protect and preserve the ecological features of the site and its immediate surroundings.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Implement strategies to prevent and control construction activity pollution, including:
    * Erosion brought about by stormwater,
    * Construction wastewater runoff,
    * Construction related sediments reaching receiving watercourses, and
    * Air pollution brought about by dust and particulate matters;
2. Conduct site assessment on the project to identify existing critical ecological features within the site and its immediate surroundings, including:
    * Trees of significant ecological value, as declared by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources – Forest Management Bureau (DENR-FMB),
    * Natural watercourses, and
    * Wetland areas.

If there are existing critical ecological features, the project team must also:

1. Identify appropriate strategies to protect the critical ecological features within the site and its immediate surroundings;
3. Implement the identified strategies prior to any preliminary site construction or preparation works, including site clearing and constructing temporary site facilities, and until the completion of the project;
4. Conduct a site assessment on the implementation of the strategies after the construction of the project; and
5. Identify and implement appropriate strategies for the continuous protection of the ecological features after the construction of the project.


### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Records on the strategies to prevent and control construction activity pollution, which should include:
    * Relevant sections of plans and specifications of the strategies,
    * Policies and procedures on preventing erosion and air pollution,
    * Purchase orders and official receipts,
    * Service contracts, and
    * Communication with project team on the strategies for construction activity pollution control;
* Site assessment report with information on existing critical ecological features in the project site and its immediate surrounding.

If there are existing critical ecological features, the project team must also submit:

* Plans and specifications on the measures for the protection of the existing critical ecological features in the site and its immediate surroundings; and
* Policies and procedures for the continuous protection of the existing critical ecological features extending past the construction of the project.

If there are no existing critical ecological features, the project team must also submit a duly signed report from a licensed environmental planner or landscape architect certifying there are no existing critical ecological features in the site.

#### Stage 2
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:
    * Changes in the submission for Stage 1, and
    * Narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Records on the implemented strategies to prevent and control construction activity pollution, which should include:
    * Relevant sections of as-built plans and specifications of the strategies, and
    * Monitoring reports, and
    * Photographs;

If there are existing critical ecological features, the project team must also submit:
* Site assessment report confirming existing critical ecological features in the site and its immediate surroundings were effectively protected during construction;
* As-built plans and specifications of the implemented measures for the protection of the existing critical ecological features in the site and its immediate surroundings; and
* Records on the implemented strategies, which should include:
    * Official receipts or sales invoices,
    * Delivery receipts,
    * Installation records,
    * Monitoring reports,
    * Service contracts, and
    * Photographs.
