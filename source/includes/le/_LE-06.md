## LE-06  Flood Risk Minimization
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Reduce the risk to flooding; and
* Reduce the impact of flooding to the project.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Conduct site assessment on the flooding risks of the site; and
2. Locate the project in a low flooding risk area.

If the project is in a flood prone area, the project team must:

1. Identify appropriate adaptive measures to reduce impact of flooding, which should include:
    * Raising the main floor level at least 0.60 meters above the highest elevation of the flood level,
    * Providing elevated bridges and walkways,
    * Providing standby inflatable rafts in case of emergencies, or
    * Policies and procedures for evacuation and rescue operations;
2. Implement the identified strategies for flood risk minimization in the project.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit; and
* Flooding assessment report for the site showing the highest flood level data based on information from the local government, the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) or the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

If the project is located in a flood prone area, the project team must also submit:

* Plans and specifications, reflecting information on:
    * Flooding adaptive measures,
    * Evacuation and rescue strategies, and
    * Height of the highest elevation of flooding in the site;
* Policies and procedures for evacuation and rescue;
* Purchase orders and service contracts.
