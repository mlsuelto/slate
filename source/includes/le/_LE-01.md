## LE-01  Land Reuse
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Discourage the use of greenfield or undeveloped green open spaces, natural habitat, or land used for food production or agriculture; and
* Promote the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield or previously developed land.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Conduct site assessment before implementing the project, which must include information on:
    * Footprint of the previously developed building in the site,
    * Previous use or type of building in the site,
    * Period the land was previously used, and
    * Site contamination;
2. Construct the project on a previously developed land used for institutional, industrial, commercial or residential applications, for the last twenty (20) years, except for food production or agriculture uses;

If land is contaminated, the project team must also:
1. Implement the necessary land remediation measures based on the _ASTM E1903-11 Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Process_ prior to the redevelopment of the site; and
2. Conduct a final site assessment showing the conditions of the site after remediation measures.

### Compliance
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Report on the initial site assessment, which should include information on:
    * Footprint of the previously developed building in the site,
    * Previous use or type of building in the site,
    * Period the land was previously used, and
    * Site contamination;
* Site plan showing:
    * Total area of the previously developed land, and
    * Building footprint of the project.

If the land is contaminated, the project team must submit a report on the implemented land remediation measures, which should include:
* Summary of the strategies implemented for land remediation,
* Service contract for the implemented strategies for land remediation, and
* Test results of the land conditions after implementing the land remediation.
