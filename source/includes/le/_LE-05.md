## LE-05  Heat Island Reduction
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to minimize the contribution of the project to the increase in temperature of the immediate microclimate of the site.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify appropriate strategies for the project to reduce heat absorption, which should include:
    * Vegetated open spaces,
    * Green roofs and green walls,
    * Open-grid pavement systems with vegetation for hardscapes,
    * Shaded hardscapes using trees, vegetation, or placing under roof structures, or
    * Roofing materials and shading structures having the following specifications:
        * Roof pitch less than 15° must have:
            * An initial solar reflectance index (SRI) more than 82, or
            * A three-year SRI more than 64.
        * Roof pitch more than 15° must have:
            * An initial SRI more than 39, or
            * A three-year SRI more than 34.
2. Implement appropriate strategies to reduce heat absorption for at least fifty percent (50%) of all horizontal surfaces in the project site, which includes landscapes, hardscapes, and roofing.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Plans and specifications, which should include information on:
    * Total site area,
    * Established strategies to reduce heat absorption for the project,
    * SRI values of roofing materials and shading structures;
* Report on the calculations showing the total horizontal area with potentially reduced heat absorption; and
* Purchase orders on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design of the project.

| Points | Compliance Requirements |
|:------:|------------------------|
| **3**  | Submitted plans and specifications for the identified strategies, and report on the calculations showing the potential reduced heat absorption of seventy percent (70%) and above of total horizontal surfaces based on the identified strategies. |
| **2**  | Submitted plans and specifications for the identified strategies, and report on the calculations showing the potential reduced heat absorption of sixty percent (60%) to less than seventy percent (<70%) of total horizontal surfaces based on the identified strategies. |
| **1**  | Submitted plans and specifications for the identified strategies, and report on the calculations showing the potential reduced heat absorption of fifty percent (50%) to less than sixty percent (<60%) of total horizontal surfaces based on the identified strategies. |


#### Stage 2
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:
    * Changes in the submission for Stage 1, and
    * Narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* As-built plans and specifications of implemented strategies, which should include:
    * Total area with implemented strategies for reduced heat absorption, and
    * SRI values of roofing materials and shading structures;
* Report on the calculations showing the total horizontal area with reduced heat absorption;
* Records on the implemented strategies, which should include:
    * Official receipts or sales invoices,
    * Delivery receipts,
    * Installation records,
    * Service contracts, and
    * Photographs.
