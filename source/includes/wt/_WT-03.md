## WT-03  <br>Efficient Landscape Irrigation
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Reduce the consumption of potable water by the project through water conservation and efficiency; and
* Contribute to the reduction of water demand from irrigation.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Prepare the water base case for irrigation;
    * Identify the water demand for irrigation based on the landscape features;
    * Identify water consumption rates for irrigation systems in accordance with _Revised National Plumbing Code of the Philippines_ (National Master Plumbers Association of the Philippines, 2000;
    * For irrigation systems not reflected in the _Plumbing Code_, identify the reference standard and the water consumption rates for the identified system; and
    * Calculate the water consumption for irrigation in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift;
2. Prepare the water consumption design case for irrigation;
    * Identify the strategies to reduce the potable water consumed for irrigation, which may include:
        * Rainwater harvesting,
        * Wastewater recycling,
        * Automatic irrigation controls, and
        * Use of plant species that require less or no irrigation;
    * Calculate the water consumption in irrigation in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift; and
    * Calculate the percentage of potential water consumption reduction compared to the water consumption base case for irrigation;
3. Implement the identified design case for irrigation.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Water base case report for irrigation, which should include:
    * Water consumption rates for landscape features for the project,
    * Water consumption rates in accordance with the _Plumbing Code_,
    * For irrigation systems not reflected in the _Plumbing Code_, submit the:
        * Relevant section of the reference standard identified, and
        * Energy consumption rates for the identified system;
    * Information on the projected occupancy rates, and
    * Calculation of the water consumption base case for irrigation in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift;
* Water consumption design case report for irrigation, which should include:
    * Information on the computed occupancy rates,
    * Calculation of the potential water consumption design case for irrigation in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift, and
    * Calculation on the percentage of water consumption reduction for irrigation compared to the water consumption base case;
* Purchase orders on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design of the project.

#### Stage 2
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:
    * Changes from the submission for Stage 1,
    * Narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Calculation of the reduced potable water based on the implemented strategies compared to the base case; and
* Records on the implementation of the identified strategies to reduce water consumption for irrigation, which should include:
    * As-built plans and specifications on the implemented strategies,
    * Official receipts or sales invoices,
    * Delivery receipts,
    * Installation records,
    * Commissioning reports,
    * Service contracts, and
    * Photographs.
