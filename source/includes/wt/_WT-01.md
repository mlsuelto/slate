## WT-01  <br>Water Consumption Reduction
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Reduce the consumption of potable water by the project through water conservation and efficiency; and
* Reduce overall potable water demand.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the target percentage water consumption reduction for the project;
2. Prepare the water consumption base case for the project, excluding irrigation:
    * Identify the water-consuming systems in the design of the project, which should include:
        * Mechanical equipment,
        * Plumbing fixtures and fittings, which must include:
            * Water closets,

            * Faucets, and
            * Showers,
        * Recycled water system,
        * Rainwater collection, and
        * Other process water for appliances which should include:
            * Dishwashers, and
            * Washing machines;
    * Identify the water consumption rates of the identified systems in the design in accordance with the _Revised National Plumbing Code of the Philippines_ (National Master Plumbers Association of the Philippines, 2000);
    * For water-consuming systems not reflected in the _Plumbing Code_, identify the reference standard and the water consumption rates for the identified system;
    * Calculate the peak water consumption base case in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift;
3. Prepare the water consumption design case for the project;
    * Identify the water efficiency and conservation strategies in the design of the project, which should include:
        * Water efficient mechanical equipment,
        * Water efficient plumbing fixtures and fittings,
        * Rainwater collection,
        * Recycled water system, and
        * Water efficient appliances;
    * Use consumption rates for the identified water efficiency and conservation strategies for the design case of the project;
    * Calculate the potential peak water consumption in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift; and
    * Calculate the percentage of potential water consumption reduction compared to the water consumption base case;
4. Implement the design case in the design and construction of the project to achieve the calculated water consumption reduction.

        * Relevant section of the reference standard identified, and
        * Water consumption rates for the identified system;
    * Information on the projected occupancy rates, and
    * Calculation of the water consumption base case in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift;
* Water design case report, which should include:
    * Relevant sections on plans and specifications showing the proposed water efficiency and conservation strategies,
    * Schedule of loads showing the water consumption rates of the identified water consuming systems in the project,
    * Electrical plans showing location of equipment and devices,
    * Information on the computed occupancy rates,
    * Calculation of the potential water consumption design case in liters per person (L/person) based on an 8-hour shift, and
    * Calculation on the percentage of water consumption reduction compared to the water consumption base case;
* Purchase orders on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design case of the project.
