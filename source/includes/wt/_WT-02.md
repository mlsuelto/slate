## WT-02  <br>Water Monitoring
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Measure and monitor the consumption of potable water in the project;
* Support project owners in effectively managing water consumption; and
* Improve the water-consuming systems of the project by promoting proper monitoring and easy responding through the installation of water meters.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the water-consuming systems in the design of the project, which should include:
    * Monitor the total water consumption for the whole building;
    * Clearly identify the scope of each meter; and
    * Install meters easily accessible for reading and maintenance;
2. Establish policies and procedures for water monitoring in the project, which must include:
    * Meter reading,
    * Recording and documentation,
    * Calibration and maintenance of each meters in accordance to the manufacturer's calibration schedule, and
    * Regular reporting of water consumption to the project owners;
3. Install the water meters for the identified water consuming systems.

If there is a building automation system (BAS), connect the water meters to the BAS.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Plan and schedule of water meters, which should include information:
    * Scope of each meter,
    * Location of the water meters,
* Policies and procedures for water monitoring, which must include:
    * Method and schedule for meter reading,
