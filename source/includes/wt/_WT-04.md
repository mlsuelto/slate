## WT-04  <br>Effluent Quality Monitoring

### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to reduce the impact on the local environment by effectively managing the quality of effluent discharge of the project.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the minimum effluent standards appropriate for each body of water for the project in accordance with _Section 7, General Effluent Standards, Department of Environment and Natural Resources Administrative Order No. 2016-08: Water Quality Guidelines and General Effluent Standards of 2016_.
2. Connect to an existing sewage treatment plant (STP) or implement effluent treatment strategies to ensure quality of effluent from the project;
3. Implement the identified strategies to manage the effluent of the project.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit; and
* Policy on the identified target minimum effluent standards for the project.

If the project has access to a sewage treatment plant (STP), the project team must submit:

* Relevant sections of plans and specifications showing:
    * Location of STP,
    * Existing sewer lines, and
    * Location of a tapping point or sampling point.

If the project has no access to STP, the project team must submit:

* Relevant sections of plans and specifications showing the identified strategies; and
* Purchase orders on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design of the project.

| Points | Compliance Requirements |
|:------:|------------------------|
| **3**  | If the project has access to an STP, submitted plans and specifications reflecting connection to a STP, and policy to ensure the highest effluent quality level. |
| **3**  | If the project has no access to an STP, submitted plans and specifications on the effluent treatment strategies, and policy to ensure the highest effluent quality level. |
| **1**  | If the project has access to an STP, submitted plans and specifications reflecting connection to a STP, and policy for the target effluent quality compliant with the minimum required level. |
| **1**  | If the project has no access to an STP, submitted plans and specifications on the effluent treatment strategies, and policy for the target effluent quality compliant with the minimum required level. |


#### Stage 2
The project team must submit an accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:

* Changes in the submission for Stage 1, and
* Narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;

If the project was connected to a STP, the project team must submit relevant sections of as-built plans and specifications showing:

* Location of STP,
* Existing sewer lines, and
* Location of a tapping point or sampling point.

If the project has no access to STP, the project team must submit:

* Relevant sections of plans and specifications showing the identified strategies; and
* Records on the implemented strategies, which should include:
   * Official receipts or sales invoices,
   * Installation records,
   * Delivery receipts,
   * Commissioning reports,
   * Service contracts, and
   * Photographs.

| Points | Compliance Requirements |

| **3**  | If the project has access to an STP, submitted as-built plans, specifications and implementation records reflecting connection to a STP, and policy to ensure the highest effluent quality level. |
| **3**  | If the project has no access to an STP, submitted as-built plans, specifications and implementation records on the effluent treatment strategies, and policy to ensure the highest effluent quality level. |
| **1**  | If the project has access to an STP, submitted as-built plans, specifications and implementation records reflecting connection to a STP, and policy for the target effluent quality compliant with the minimum required level. |
| **1**  | If the project has no access to an STP, submitted plans, specifications and implementation records on the effluent treatment strategies, and policy for the target effluent quality compliant with the minimum required level. |
