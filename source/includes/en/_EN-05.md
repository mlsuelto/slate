2. Prepare the energy design case for lighting using energy efficient lighting;
    * Identify maximum allowable building average lighting power density (LPD) for the project in accordance with _Tables EN-05-1 and EN-05-2, Maximum allowed LPD, Philippine Green Building Code (GB Code)_ (Department of Public Works and Highways, June 2015):

    * Identify energy efficient lighting fixtures for all regularly occupied spaces in the project, which should comply with:
        * Minimum luminous efficacy of 80 lumens per watt (lm/W),

    * Calculate the energy consumption for lighting the whole building in kilowatts per square meter per person (kW/m<sup>2</sup>/person) based on an 8-hour shift; and
    * Calculate the percentage of potential energy consumption reduction compared to the energy consumption base case for lighting;
3. Install energy efficient lighting fixtures in all regularly occupied spaces in the project.
