## EN-03  Natural Ventilation

### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Maximize the use of natural ventilation for cooling interior spaces; and
* Reduce the energy demand from cooling.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Design at least fifty percent (50%) of all regularly occupied ventilated spaces with natural ventilation, which must comply with Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers _Application Manual 10: Natural Ventilation in Non-Domestic Buildings (CIBSE AM10)_ (CIBSE, 2015);
2. Prepare the energy base case for cooling the whole building;
    * Identify energy consumption rates for cooling in accordance with _Philippine Electrical Code (PEC)_ of the Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers (IIEE, 2009);
    * For cooling systems not reflected in the _PEC_, identify the reference standard and the energy consumption rates for the identified system; and
    * Calculate the energy consumption in cooling the whole building in kilowatts per square meter per person (kW/m<sup>2</sup>/person) based on an 8-hour shift;
3. Prepare the energy design case for cooling integrating natural ventilation;
    * Identify the total area of naturally ventilated spaces in the design of the project;
    * Calculate the energy consumption in cooling the whole building integrating natural ventilation in kilowatts per square meter per person (kW/m<sup>2</sup>/person) based on an 8-hour shift; and
    * Calculate the percentage of potential energy consumption reduction compared to the energy consumption base case for cooling;
4. Implement the design case in the design and construction of the project to achieve the calculated energy consumption reduction for cooling.
