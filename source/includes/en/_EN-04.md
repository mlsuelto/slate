### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Prepare the energy consumption base case for the project:

            * Elevators, and
            * Escalators;
        * Identify energy consumption rates for each energy consuming systems in the design in accordance with _Philippine Electrical Code (PEC)_ of the Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers (IIEE, 2009);
        * For energy-consuming systems not reflected in the _PEC_, identify the reference standard and the energy consumption rates for the identified system;
        * Calculate the peak energy consumption base case in kilowatts per square meter per person (kW/m<sup>2</sup>/person) based on an 8-hour shift;
2. Use renewable energy to offset at least five percent (5%) of the building's total energy demand;
    * If the project owner intends to use on-site renewable energy,
        * Identify the appropriate on-site renewable energy technology for the project, which should include:
           * Solar power,
           * Wind power,
           * Hydro power,
           * Geothermal power, and
           * Biomass;
        * Install the identified renewable energy technology for the project.
    * If the project owner intends to use off-site renewable energy, the project must purchase renewable energy from a licensed renewable retail energy supplier for 100% electricity demand of the project.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Energy base case report, which should include:
    * If the project targeted _EN-01 Energy Consumption Reduction_, use the energy base case report; or
    * If the project has not conducted an energy base case for the project,
        * List of energy-consuming systems in the design of the project,
        * Energy consumption rates in accordance with the _PEC_,
        * For energy-consuming systems not reflected in the _PEC_, submit the:
            * Relevant section of the reference standard identified, and
            * Energy consumption rates for the identified system;
        * Information on the projected occupancy rates, and
        * Calculation of the energy consumption base case in kilowatts per square meter per person (kW/m<sup>2</sup>/person) based on an 8-hour shift.

If the project owner intends to use on-site renewable energy, the project team must submit:
* Feasibility report on the use of the identified on-site renewable energy technology in the project, which should include:
    * Information on the energy source for the technology,
    * Technical specifications of the on-site renewable energy technology showing energy output generation to be contributed in the project,
    * Calculation on the potential energy generated by the technology, and
    * Calculation on the percentage of potential energy off-set from the renewable energy technology based on the energy base case;
* Relevant sections on plans and specifications for the renewable energy technology, which should include:
    * Technical specifications of the on-site renewable energy technology, and
    * Location of the technology in the site;
* Records showing intent of using on-site renewable technology, which should include:
    * Purchase orders on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design of the project, or
    * Service contract with a renewable technology supplier confirming the intent of using on-site renewable energy in the project for at least five (5) years.

If the project owner intends to use off-site renewable energy, the project team must submit forms of communication with a licensed renewable retail energy supplier, which should include:

* Approved proposal for purchase of 100% renewable energy for at least five (5) years from a licensed renewable retail energy supplier; and
* Minutes of meetings showing discussions on the purchase of the renewable energy between the project owner and the licensed renewable retail energy supplier.

| Points | Compliance Requirements |
|:------:|------------------------|
| **2**  | Submitted approved proposal and other forms of communication showing intent on purchasing 100% renewable energy from a licensed renewable energy supplier for the entire project for at least five (5) years.|
| **2**  | Submitted plans and specifications, reports and records showing the design of the use of on-site renewable energy with an offset of ten percent (10%) or more of the base case energy consumption of the project. |
| **1**  | Submitted plans and specifications, reports and records showing the design of the use of on-site renewable energy with an offset of five percent (5%) to less than ten percent (<10%) of the base case energy consumption of the project. |

#### Stage 2
The project team must submit an accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:

* Changes in the submission for Stage 1, and
* Narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;

If the project owner installed on-site renewable energy, the project team must submit:

* Relevant sections on as-built plans and specifications for the renewable energy technology, which should include:
    * Technical specifications of the on-site renewable energy technology, and
    * Location of the technology in the site;
* Records on the installed on-site renewable energy technologies, which should include:
    * Official receipts or sales invoices,
