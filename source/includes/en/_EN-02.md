## EN-02  Energy Monitoring

### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Measure and monitor the energy consumption in the project;
* Support project owners in effectively managing energy consuming systems; and
* Improve the energy-consuming systems of the project by promoting proper monitoring and easily responding through the installation of energy meters.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the energy meters to be installed in the project;
    * Monitor the total energy consumption for the whole building;
    * Clearly identify the scope of each meter; and
    * Install meters easily accessible for reading and maintenance;
2. Establish policies and procedures for energy monitoring in the project, which must include:
    * Meter reading,
    * Recording and documentation,
    * Calibration and maintenance of each meters in accordance to the manufacturer's calibration schedule, and
    * Regular reporting of energy consumption to the project owners;
3. Install the energy meters for the identified energy consuming systems.

If there is a building automation system (BAS), connect the energy meters to the BAS.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Plan and schedule of energy meters, which should include information:
    * Scope of each meter,
    * Location of the energy meters,
* Policies and procedures for energy monitoring, which must include:
    * Method and schedule for meter reading,
    * Recording and documentation,
    * Calibration and maintenance of each meters in accordance to the manufacturer's calibration schedule,
    * Method and schedule for reporting of energy consumption to the project owners, and
    * Responsible parties for the implementation of the policies and procedures;
* Purchase orders of the meters.

If there is a BAS, relevant section of the plans and specifications showing how the energy meters will be connected to the BAS.
