## EN-06  Energy Efficient Building Envelope

### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Reduce cooling requirements of projects by reducing heat gain into all interior spaces; and
* Reduce cooling requirements of projects by ensuring low air infiltration in air conditioned spaces.

### Requirement
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Design the building envelope in compliance with:
    * _ANSI/ASHRAE/IES/USGBC Standard 189.1-2014, Standard for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings_, Table A-1 Building Envelope Requirements for Climate Zone 1 (A, B) for building envelope heat transfer properties;
    * _ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2016 – Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings_, with an average air leakage of 2 L/s-m<sup>2</sup> at 75 Pa in accordance with:
        * _ASTM E779-10, Standard Test Method for Determining Air Leakage Rate by Fan Pressurization_, or
        * An equivalent methodology for testing air tightness for air-conditioned spaces;
    * Department of Energy (DOE) Guidelines on Energy Conserving Design of Buildings:
        * Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV) for the exterior walls and roofs of buildings and must not exceed 45 W/m<sup>2</sup> – for buildings with 175 kW cooling load or greater; and
        * The Maximum Thermal Transmittance Values of roofs in watts per square meter Kelvin (W/m<sup>2</sup>K) in accordance with the _Table EN-06-1: Maximum Thermal Transmittance Values of roofs_

    _Table EN-06-1. Maximum Thermal Transmittance Values of roofs_

    | Roof Type | Description               | A/C  | Non-A/C |
    |:---------:|:-------------------------:|:----:|:----:|
    | Light     | under 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup> | 0.50 | 0.80 |
    | Medium    | 50-230 kg/m<sup>2</sup>   | 0.80 | 1.10 |
    | Heavy     | 50-230 kg/m<sup>2</sup>   | 1.20 | 1.50 |
