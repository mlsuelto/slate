## EN-07  Energy Efficient Air-conditioning System

### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Reduce energy consumption of the project through the procurement and use of energy efficient air-conditioning systems; and
* Reduce energy demand of the project from cooling.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Prepare the energy base case for cooling the whole building;
    * If the project team targeted _EN-03 Natural Ventilation_, use the energy base case for cooling; or
    * If the project has not conducted an energy base case for cooling,
        * Identify energy consumption rates for cooling in accordance with _Philippine Electrical Code (PEC)_ of the Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers (IIEE, 2009);
        * For cooling systems not reflected in the _PEC_, identify the reference standard and the energy consumption rates for the identified system; and
        * Calculate the energy consumption in cooling the whole building in kilowatts per square meter per person (kW/m<sup>2</sup>/person) based on an 8-hour shift;
2. Prepare the energy design case for cooling integrating energy efficient air-conditioning systems;
    * Identify energy efficient air-conditioning system for the project with the minimum performance based on the _Philippine Green Building Code, Section 10. Energy Efficiency, Subsection 10.5.1 Air Conditioning System_;
    * Calculate the energy consumption in cooling integrating energy efficient air-conditioning systems in kilowatts per square meter per person (kW/m<sup>2</sup>/person) based on an 8-hour shift; and
    * Calculate the percentage of potential energy consumption reduction compared to the energy consumption base case for cooling;
3. Install the identified energy efficient air-conditioning system in the project.
