## EM-03  Emission Control
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Provide and implement measures to mediate the emissions from projects; and
* Reduce environmental impact of the project by reducing emissions from equipment.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the emission levels required for the project based on the _Republic Act No. 8749, Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999_ and its regulations;
2. Establish an emission control plan, which should include:
    * Identifying the applicable standards for emissions based on source in the project,
    * Identifying strategies to mitigate emissions applicable to the source in the project,
    * Proper maintenance of equipment and emission control systems, and
    * Periodic emission testing of equipment.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Report on the identified emission sources designed in the project, which should include:
    * List of sources of emissions in the design of the project, and
    * Applicable air quality level based on the source;
* Emission control plan, which should include:
    * Strategies to mitigate emissions applicable to the identified source,
    * Schedule of maintenance,
    * Maintenance procedure,
    * Schedule of periodic emission testing of equipment,
    * Communicating emission control policies and procedures to the project team, external contractors, service providers, and users of the project,
    * Monitoring of implementation of the policies and procedures for emission control, and
