## EM-02  Refrigerants
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Reduce ozone depletion; and
* Encourage project owners to minimize the environmental impact caused by the use of refrigerants in projects.

### Requirements
If the project is not using refrigerants, the project team must confirm absence of refrigerants in the project.

If the project is using refrigerants, the project team must:

1. Identify refrigerants that have no ozone depleting substances (ODS);
2. Establish policies and procedures to use only non-ODS refrigerants in the project;
3. Implement established strategies; and
4. Establish strategies to continuously monitor, detect, and contain refrigerant leakages.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Communication with the project team, external contractors, service providers and users of the project on the implementation of the strategies; and
* Purchase order on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design of the project.

If the project is not using refrigerants, the project team must also submit:

* Certification from the project owner that there is no system designed in the project that uses refrigerants, or
* Certification from the manufacturer that equipment or systems designed in the project do not require the use of refrigerants.

If the project is using refrigerants, the project team must also submit:

* Relevant sections on specifications showing the equipment and the refrigerant used for each system,
* Building commissioning plan identifying the equipment using refrigerants,
* Policies and procedures on the use of non-ODS refrigerants,
    * Communicating policies and procedures for refrigerants to the project team, external contractors, service providers, and users of the project,
    * Monitoring of implementation of the policies and procedures for refrigerants, and
    * Information on responsible parties for implementing the policies and procedures;
* Relevant sections on plans and specifications on the leak detection system in the project.


| Points | Compliance Requirements |
|:------:|------------------------|
| **3**  | Submitted certification confirming no refrigerants were used in the project. |
| **3**  | Submitted policies and procedures to use non-ODS refrigerants, relevant sections on specifications showing the use of non-ODS refrigerants, and relevant sections on plans and specifications of the leak detection system. |
| **1**  | Submitted policies and procedures to use non-ODS refrigerants, and relevant sections on specifications showing the use of non-ODS refrigerants. |


#### Stage 2
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:
    * Changes in the submission for Stage 1, and
    * Narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;

If the project is not using refrigerants, confirmation on the absence of refrigerants in the project, which should include:

* Certification from the project owner that there is no system designed in the project that uses refrigerants, or
* Certification from the manufacturer that equipment or systems designed in the project do not require the use of refrigerants.

If the project is using refrigerants, records on the implemented strategies should include:

* Official receipts or sales invoices,
* Delivery receipts,
* Installation records,
* Commissioning reports, and
* Service contracts.

If the project established a leak detection system, records on the implemented strategies should include:

* Relevant sections on as-built plans and specifications of the leak detection system implemented,
* Official receipts or sales invoices,
* Delivery receipts,
* Installation records,
* Commissioning reports,
* Service contracts, and
* Photographs.
