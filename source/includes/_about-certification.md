## What is _**BERDE**_ Certification?
_**BERDE**_ Certification is the formal assessment, rating, and certification process for projects of the _**BERDE**_ Program.

Only projects that complete the formal process, complies with all requirements, and receives at least the minimum rating for certification may claim as a _**BERDE**_ Certified green building project.

## Who will certify my project?
The PHILGBC will certify the project based on the outcomes from the assessments during the _**BERDE**_ Certification process.

The PHILGBC or its authorized assessment body will facilitate and conduct the assessment, rating, and certification process.  The PHILGBC builds trust and confidence in the system by managing and addressing conflicts of interests between the project, the project team, and the assessment team assigned for the project.

## How can I get _**BERDE**_ Certified?
The project must complete the _**BERDE**_ Certification process, comply with all minimum system requirements, and achieve the minimum rating for certification.

## Acceptable documents for _**BERDE**_ Certification
Project teams must submit documented information to demonstrate how the project complies with their target credits.  These documents allow the assessment team to assess, verify, and monitor the project's performance based on valid, credible, and verifiable information.  

It is the responsibility of the project team to prepare and submit documents that present valid, credible, and verifiable information about the project.  The documents submitted by the project team will be reviewed by the assessment team and will be referenced in the _Assessment Report_, which is the basis for the rating and certification of the project.

**Submit robust evidence demonstrating the compliance of the project with the target credits.** Project teams must submit the identified documents under `Compliance` of each credit reflecting the information needed to show compliance to the credit.  Documents under `Compliance` were identified to ensure that you are sufficiently guided on what information are–

* Necessary to comply with the credit; and
* Appropriate and relevant to each Stage of assessment.

**Use existing project files.**  You should use existing project files for the design, construction, and operations of the project.  You are not required to create or prepare documents exclusive for _**BERDE**_.  This will reduce the time and effort in preparing for the certification of the project.
