## EQ-03  Acoustic Comfort
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to ensure productivity, comfort, and wellbeing of users through appropriate acoustic levels.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the maximum allowable noise quality for each area in the project. The maximum noise levels must be based on _Implementing Rules and Regulations of Code on Sanitation of the Philippines, Chapter XIX of Nuisance and Offensive Trades and Occupations, Section 8.7 Excessive noise, Table 13. Maximum Allowable Noise Levels in General Areas_ (Department of Health, 1998);
2. Identify strategies to ensure the acoustics requirements are complied with for all indoor spaces;
3. Implement the identified strategies to ensure acoustics performance in the project;
4. During commissioning, measure the noise levels in the project:
    * In at least 10% of all spaces, which should be:
        * Representative of the different types of spaces in the project; and
        * In at least four (4) separate rooms that have the highest potential exposure to noise, such as rooms facing a busy street or rooms adjacent to a machine room;
    * Using a standard sound level meter that meets the _American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S1.4-1974_ or other specification accepted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Report on the acoustics requirements of the project, which should include:
    * List of all spaces in the project and function of each space,
    * Noise level of potential noise sources within and outside the project, and
    * Maximum allowable noise level for each space in the project;
* Relevant sections on plans and specifications for identified strategies to ensure compliance with the allowable noise level in the project; and
* Purchase order on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design of the project.

| Point | Compliance Requirement |
|:------:|------------------------|
| **1**  | Submitted plans, specifications and reports on the acoustics requirements of the project and identified strategies to ensure compliance with the allowable noise level in the project. |

#### Stage 2
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:
    * Changes in the submission for Stage 1, and
    * Narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Relevant sections on as-built plans and specifications showing the:
    * Spaces in the project,
    * Location of potential noise sources within and outside of the project, and
    * Implemented strategies for acoustics comfort;
* Records of the implementation of the strategies, which should include:
    * Official receipts or sales invoices,
    * Delivery receipts,
    * Installation records, and
    * Photographs;
* Report on the testing for noise levels in the project, which should include:
    * Testing methodology, and
    * Results of the testing.

| Point | Compliance Requirement |
|:-----:|------------------------|
| **1** | Submitted as-built plans, specifications and reports on the acoustics requirements of the project, implementation records for the strategies, and report on the testing for noise levels showing compliance with the allowable noise level in the project. |
