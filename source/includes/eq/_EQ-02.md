## EQ-02  Thermal Comfort
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to ensure productivity, comfort, and wellbeing of users through appropriate thermal levels;

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the cooling load requirements for regularly occupied spaces in the project, in accordance with _ASHRAE 55-2013: Thermal Environmental Condition for Human Occupancy_;
2. Identify strategies to maintain appropriate thermal level, which may include:
    * Maximizing and maintaining natural ventilation;
    * Providing controls for air-conditioning at the zone, area, or individual user level; and
3. Implement strategies to ensure appropriate thermal levels for users.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative on how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Report on the evaluation of the thermal levels in the design of the project, which must include information on:
    * Thermal modeling confirming thermal levels in the project are within the required limits, or
    * Calculations showing thermal levels in the project are within the required limits;
* Schedule of thermal controls, which should include information on:
    * Required thermal level per location or task as identified in the model or calculations,
    * Location of thermal control system,
    * Type or function of each control,
    * Location or task for each control, and
    * Scope of each thermal control;
* Purchase order on the specified products, materials or equipment in the design of the project.
