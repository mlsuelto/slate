## WS-01  Construction Waste Diversion
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Ensure the effective management of waste;
* Divert waste from landfills; and
* Reduce waste produced in the project.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Identify the target percentage of construction waste diversion for the project.
2. Prepare the base case for the potential construction waste generation in the project;
    * Identify the potential sources and amount of waste in the project during construction; and
    * Calculate the peak construction waste generation in kilograms (kg);
3. Establish a waste management system, which should include:
    * Strategies to divert waste from landfill during construction, which may include:
        * Reusing materials on site or in other sites,
        * Reducing overall waste generation, or
        * Recycling;
    * Procedures for the implementation of the strategies during construction; and
    * Communication with the project team, external contractors, and suppliers for the waste management system of the project; and
4. Implement the strategies to divert waste from the project during construction;
5. Calculate the percentage of diverted waste during construction.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_, which should include:
    * Summary of the waste management system, and
    * Narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Policy on the target construction waste diversion for the project;
* Construction waste base case report, which should include information on:
    * Sources of waste in the project, and
    * Potential amount of waste in kilograms (kg);
* Waste management system, which should include information on:
    * Strategies to divert waste during construction,
    * Procedures for the implementation of the strategies, and
    * Communication plan for the implementation of the strategies;
* Communication with the project team, external contractors, and suppliers for the waste management system of the project.
