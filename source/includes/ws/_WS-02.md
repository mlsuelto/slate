## WS-02  Materials Recovery Facility
### Purpose and Intent
This credit aims to:

* Ensure the effective management of waste; and
* Reduce burden for additional infrastructure for waste by properly managing waste from the source.

### Requirements
Requirements for this credit are the following:

1. Prepare the base case for the potential waste generation for the construction and operations of the building;
    * Identify the potential sources and amount of waste in the project; and
    * Calculate the peak construction waste generation in kilograms (kg);
2. Design a materials recovery facility (MRF) for the construction and operations of the project.  The MRF must comply with the following:
    * Clearly marked areas for segregated waste, which should include:
        * Biodegradable wastes,
        * Non-biodegradable wastes, and
        * Recyclable wastes;
    * Allocated adequate space to store the projected amount of waste generated during the construction and operation of the building, with the following minimum space:
        * For projects with a total gross floor area of less than 5000 m<sup>2</sup>, provide 2 m<sup>2</sup> of net floor for the MRF per 1000m<sup>2</sup> of the project;
        * For projects with a total gross floor area equal to or more than 5000 m<sup>2</sup>,
           * Provide a minimum of 10m<sup>2</sup> for the MRF; and
           * Where catering is provided, an additional 2 m<sup>2</sup> per 1000 m<sup>2</sup>;
    * Located within the project site; and
    * Provided with sufficient access for vehicles for collection;
3. Establish policies and procedures for the use of the MRF for the construction and operations of the project, which should include waste management procedures for:
    * Segregation,
    * Collection,
    * Handling, and
    * Disposal of waste.

  If the project targeted _WS-01 Construction Waste Diversion_, use the policies and procedures in managing construction waste.

4. Construct the MRF.

### Compliance
#### Stage 1
The project team must submit:

* Accomplished _Template - Credit Submission_ with a narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Waste generation base case report, which should include information on:
    * Sources of waste for the construction and operations of the project, and
    * Projected amount of waste for each identified source in kilograms (kg);
* Plans and specifications for the MRF, which should include information on:
    * Areas for the different types of wastes,
    * Minimum required area of the MRF in square meters (m<sup>2</sup>),
    * Total area of the MRF in square meters (m<sup>2</sup>),
    * Location of the MRF, and
    * Access of collection vehicles to the MRF;
* Policies and procedures for the use of the MRF for the construction and operations of the project, which should include:
    * Segregation,
    * Collection,
    * Handling, and
    * Disposal of wastes;

    * Narrative how the project complied with the requirements of the credit;
* Records of the construction of the MRF, which should include:
    * As-built plans and specifications of the MRF, which should include information on:
        * Location of the MRF,
        * Total area of the MRF, and
        * Access to the MRF;
    * Official receipts or sales invoices,
    * Installation records,
    * Service contracts, and
    * Photographs;
* Records of the use of the MRF during construction, which should include:
    * Log of generated construction wastes,
    * Monitoring reports,
    * Photographs, and
    * Communication with the project team and contractors on the procedures for the use of the MRF.
